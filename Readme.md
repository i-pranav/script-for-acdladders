This script is a shitty code, and not productionised at all (Neither do I have any plans of doing the same)

fwiw, the index.js contains a method -> populateAllActiveUsers
    - this creates a json file (cfusers.json) which is further used to query all the users who have been actively participating in the contests

getAllEligibleProblems() is the function which needs to be called to populate the problems! 
    - this funcion supports resuming processing from a given checkpoint to avoid recomputation.
